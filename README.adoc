== About the App

=== Introduction
An avid book reader is always on the lookout for new releases especially from the authors that they love. However, there is no such tool today which informs you about upcoming releases. “Author Follow” allows you to keep tabs on upcoming and recent releases of your favorite book authors, search for new authors and more. This app uses Amazon’s product release API to scour for their favorite authors’ publications.
